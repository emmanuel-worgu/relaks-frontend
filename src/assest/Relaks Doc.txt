Is the JobsChosen that we get the jobs from the handymen/get-all-jobs route.

Once the customer give reviews it clears the jobChosen Array which will return undefined in our frontend.

If we don't clear the jobsChosen Array our handymen can't be able to choose another job..

So we should make it Possible that the job is not loaded from the jobsChosen Array.
